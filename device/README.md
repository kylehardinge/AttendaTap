# Building code for the device

Following the instructions here - https://esp-rs.github.io/book/installation/index.html - follow the instructions based on your chip
Right now, I have an Xstensa chip, the esp32-wroom-32. It's a vanilla esp32, no v3 or s or anything.
You could also (probably) use a container provided by Espressif - check here for that: https://esp-rs.github.io/book/installation/using-containers.html

The build directory is AttendaTap/device
